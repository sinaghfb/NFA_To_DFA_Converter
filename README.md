This program is written in C ++ language and has been tested to be optimal in terms of reader and summary, and to pay attention to the issue of memory complexity, but in the worst case, there may be possible consumption of tribal memory. If you need the code of this program in the form of open source with MIT license is also uploaded on the Github site (github).
 The purpose of this program is educational and it has tried to be a reader award and for this reason it may not be optimal in other cases of time complexity and memory and this program is available to the public in open source. I would be very grateful if it would be suggested to improve this. The app will notify you.
